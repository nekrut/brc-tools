# off-diagonal 1.0 that is a self-comparison, and a genome was absent -- exit 0. `../escaped` wrote
# the signature outside the job directory. Staging by INDEX (below) removed both hazards from the
# SKETCH, and an earlier version of this comment concluded that what was left was only a cosmetic
# label problem. That is no longer true in either half:
#   * the name still travels into `--name` and becomes a COLUMN LABEL in similarity.csv, where a
#     leading dash or an embedded path reads as a malformed strain and joins against nothing; and
#   * the name is a FILENAME again -- `signatures/{name}.sig`, published as the discovered
#     `signatures` collection at the end of this script. `gA` and `./gA` would collide there
#     exactly as they once did in `stage/`, and `../escaped` would write outside the work dir.
# So this guard is load-bearing for the data and not just for the labels; the count check beside
# the publish step is the second line of defence.

# ⛔ COMPARE IN THE CLASSIC WRAPPER'S ORDER, NOT THE PANEL'S. sourmash's CSV columns follow the
# command line, and the classic `sourmash_compare` hands it `stage/*.sig` -- a shell glob over
# `stage/{element_identifier}.sig` -- so its columns come out in FILENAME order while this tool's
# came out in panel order. Same numbers, same labels, different sequence: two editions of WF-A
# publishing one output two ways, for no reason a reader could act on.
#
# ⚠ THIS PROJECT HAS ALREADY PAID FOR AN ALPHABETICAL-VERSUS-PANEL MISMATCH. In WF-C2, chains
# filtered out of WF-C arrived alphabetical while the grid was in panel order, and every projection
# got the WRONG CHAIN with correct-looking identifiers throughout (workflows/
# workflow_descriptions.md). Nothing reads this matrix positionally today -- multiz_fold keys off
# the header labels -- so this was a latent version of that bug and not a live one. Removing it is
# cheaper than remembering it.
#
# ⚠ SORTED ON THE FILENAME, NOT ON THE IDENTIFIER, because the filename is what the glob sorts.
# They are the same until one identifier is a PREFIX of another: `cs` and `cs-1` sort as
# ("cs", "cs-1") by identifier but ("cs-1.sig", "cs.sig") by filename, because `-` (0x2D) is below
# `.` (0x2E). Matching the glob exactly is the point, so sort what the glob sorted.
#
# ⚠ WHICH IS THE C COLLATION'S ORDER, AND THAT IS AN ASSUMPTION ABOUT THE CLASSIC'S JOB, NOT ABOUT
# THIS ONE. Bash sorts pathname expansion by LC_COLLATE, so a classic job under a non-C locale would
# order its own columns differently and this would no longer match it. Measured on laila:
# LC_ALL=C.UTF-8, which collates by codepoint. NOT verified on the production BRC instance, and not
# fixable from here -- the glob is in the classic wrapper. This matches the classic where the
# classic is known to run.
#
# ⚠ AND IT AGREES WITH `signatures` NOW. That collection is discovered with `sort_key: filename`
# over the same `{identifier}.sig` names, so the matrix columns and the collection elements come
# out in ONE order rather than two.

# ---- publish the per-strain signatures ----------------------------------------------------------
# ⛔ THE CLASSIC WORKFLOW PUBLISHES THESE AND THIS PORT DID NOT -- WF-A's one real parity loss.
# `sourmash_sketch` mapped over the panel leaves one .sig dataset per strain, described in the
# classic's own port list as "BRC-reusable"; collapsing sketch and compare into ONE job (which is
# what the identifier assertion needs) turned them into work-dir files nobody could reach. A
# discovered collection gives them back without splitting the job in two again.
#
# ⛔ AND THE FILENAME IS THE POINT, WHICH IS WHY THIS COPIES RATHER THAN DISCOVERING `stage/`.
# Discovery takes each element identifier from the FILENAME, and `stage/` is deliberately keyed by
# INDEX -- pointing discovery at it hands back a collection keyed `0000`..`000N`, which joins
# against nothing downstream: not the sizes, not the self-pairs, not the relabel map, every one of
# which keys on the strain. A collection whose identifiers are ordinals is worse than no collection
# at all, because it looks like one.
#
# ⚠ SAFE ONLY BECAUSE OF THE IDENTIFIER GUARDS ABOVE, and this is now the second reason they exist:
# a duplicate, a path separator, a dot-alias or a leading dash would collide here or write outside
# the work dir, and all four are refused before anything is sketched.
#
# ⚠ ELEMENT ORDER DIFFERS FROM THE CLASSIC'S, AND CANNOT BE MADE TO MATCH. A map-over collection
# comes out in PANEL order; discovery sorts by `sort_key`, whose choices are filename/name/
# designation/dbkey -- all of which are the strain name -- so this collection is alphabetical. Same
# elements, same identifiers, different order. Nothing in this pipeline consumes `signatures`
# positionally (it is a terminal, reusable artifact), but a consumer that did would see a
# difference between the two editions of WF-A.
#
# ⚠ MEASURED ON usegalaxy.org 26.1, 2026-09-08 -- history bbd44e69cb8906b54a726562e523b991 -- and
# the input was built so the run could REFUTE the paragraph above rather than merely agree with it:
# a panel given as `cs10, PvP01, strain.2`, whose panel order and alphabetical order differ, came
# back keyed `PvP01, cs10, strain.2`. Also confirmed there: the identifiers are the strain names and
# not `stage/`'s indices, the declared `json` format is honoured, the elements are hidden while the
# collection is visible, `strain.2` survives the discovery pattern with its dot, and the three
# sizes differ -- which is what says discovery found three files rather than one file three times.
