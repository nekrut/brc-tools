"""
Phase E — PGGB graph path co-membership edges.

Reads odgi paths --haplotypes TSV and per-strain BED annotations.
For each pair of (strain_a.gene_a, strain_b.gene_b) that share a graph path
with >= min_overlap reciprocal CDS coverage, emit an edge.

Output TSV columns: strain_a, gene_a, strain_b, gene_b, path_id, overlap

Requires: Python 3.9+
