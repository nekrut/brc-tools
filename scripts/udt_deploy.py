"""Register a User-Defined Tool on a Galaxy server and smoke-test it.

WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A SNIPPET. Porting a wrapper is a LOOP -- convert, register, run, read the
error, fix, repeat -- and each turn of it needs the same four API calls. Retyping them invites the
small differences that make one attempt not comparable with the last.

⚠ FOUR API DETAILS THAT ARE NOT IN THE OBVIOUS PLACE, each of which cost a failed attempt:

  * A UDT is INVOKED BY `tool_uuid`, not by `tool_id`. Posting the id to /api/tools returns
    "Tool not found", which reads like the registration failed when it did not.
  * There is NO UPDATE. Every `create` makes a new tool, so an unchanged `version` leaves the old
    definition sitting beside the new one and `--bump` exists to keep them distinguishable.
  * THE VERSION MUST BE PEP 440, INCLUDING WHATEVER `--bump` INVENTS. `0.1.0-probe` -- the obvious
    thing to type for a throwaway -- is refused with `400 Tool failed lint checks:
    ToolVersionPEP404`, and Galaxy's own linter calls that a WARNING, so nothing in the message
    points at the version. Checked here before the request; see pep440_ok().
  * A tool with NO data inputs fails before reaching a node -- no runner, no stderr, error in about
    a second. Give the smoke test a real input.

    The flag still wins here (it is this script's interface), but the lookup is the shared one, so
    there is one definition of what `_2` means. See galaxy_server.

    ⚠ THE SERVER IS NOT INTERCHANGEABLE, AND SLOTS ARE THE REASON TO SAY SO HERE. A UDT gets
    `GALAXY_SLOTS=1` on usegalaxy.org (measured, job 79420986) but whatever `local_slots` the
    local job_conf declares on laila -- 16 today. So a wrapper reading `$GALAXY_SLOTS` runs
    single-threaded on the server we ship to and multi-threaded on the one we test on.
