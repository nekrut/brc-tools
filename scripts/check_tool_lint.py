"""Run galaxy-tool-refactor's strict ruleset over tools/, against a per-(file, code) baseline.

    check_tool_lint.py [PATH ...] [--baseline FILE] [--write-baseline]

⚠ NEEDS `pip install galaxy-tool-refactor-registry==0.3.8` -- unlike check_tool_defects.py,
which is stdlib only. It must be the REGISTRY distribution, not galaxy-tool-lint: the lint package
does not depend on the registry, so installing it alone leaves this import failing. The version is
PINNED, because a new rule in a later release would otherwise turn CI red on a day nobody touched
this repo, and a lint gate that goes red on its own gets switched off. Raising the pin is a
maintainer step that comes with re-baselining, since a release can move counts in either
direction.

NOTHING IS EXCLUDED ANY MORE. GTR025 (<requirements>) and GTR038 (<citations>) used to be, because
they read the unexpanded tree: every wrapper declaring those through `<expand macro=.../>` was
reported as declaring nothing -- 40 of 42 GTR025 findings here and 44 of 50 GTR038 were that false
positive, which would have buried the real ones. Fixed upstream in 0.3.8, so both are back and the
8 genuine findings between them are visible.

The baseline is keyed on (file, code) and a COUNT, not on a line number or a message: line numbers
move whenever anything above them is edited, and messages get reworded between releases. Either
would make the baseline rot into a file nobody trusts.
