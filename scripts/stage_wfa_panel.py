"""Stage WF-A's three input collections on a Galaxy server from a PANEL definition.

    python3 scripts/stage_wfa_panel.py --panel panels/cannabis.panel.yml

⛔ THE PANEL IS DATA, BECAUSE THE PIPELINE IS SHARED BETWEEN TWO ORGANISM SETS. These workflows run
over a Cannabis panel and a Plasmodium one from the same code. Which genomes are in a set, which of
them carry an annotation and which serve as anchors are facts about a dataset; they used to be
module constants here, which meant a second organism could only be supported by editing this file.
Add a file under panels/ instead.

⛔ THE THREE COLLECTIONS ARE INDEPENDENT, AND CONFLATING THEM IS WHAT HELD WF-A TO SIX GENOMES.
They were all built from one dict, so `assemblies` could never be larger than the set with protein
FASTAs -- while WF-B masked nineteen. Nothing in the workflow joins them: `assemblies` feeds
sourmash, faidx and the identifier list, `proteomes` feeds BUSCO alone, `anchor_gene_gff3s` feeds
anchor_prep alone. Three branches, three gates, and only BUSCO needs an annotation.

⚠ NOTHING DOWNSTREAM COMPARES THEM EITHER. `proteomes` and `assemblies` meet only at multiqc, which
merges a BUSCO summary keyed by one collection's identifiers with plots keyed by the other's and
compares nothing -- scripts/check_workflow_ports.py says so in as many words. So the containments
are asserted here, before anything is uploaded: every anchor must have a proteome, and every
proteome must name a member of the resolved assembly set.

⛔ PROTEOMES MUST BE ONE PROTEIN PER GENE, WHICH IS NOT WHAT NCBI SHIPS. RefSeq publishes every
isoform and BUSCO reads its `duplicated` fraction straight off the file, so a proteome carrying
isoforms is reported as duplicated for a reason that is not biology. That matters wherever a panel
holds haplotype pairs, where `duplicated` genuinely means an uncollapsed haplotype.
scripts/primary_proteome.py reduces a proteome to longest-per-gene; the files this expects are
named `*_<key>_protein_primary.faa.gz`, keyed by the panel's `proteomes` values.
