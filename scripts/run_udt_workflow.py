"""Register the UDTs a workflow needs, render an instance-resolved copy, and invoke it.

This is `run_softmask_udt.py` with the softmask knowledge removed: the workflow is an argument, the
UDT set is DERIVED from the workflow rather than listed, and the inputs are named on the command
line. `run_softmask_udt.py` keeps the softmask-specific parts (uploading assemblies, `--hdca`) and
imports the two generic pieces from here, so there is one copy of each.

    python3 scripts/run_udt_workflow.py \
        --workflow workflows/align_chain_project/align_chain_udt.gxwf.yml \
        --input masked_fastas=hdca:<id> --input sizes=hdca:<id> \
        --upload self_pairs=self_pairs.txt --upload relabel_map=relabel.tsv \
        --history-name "WF-C UDT edition"

⛔ THE COMMITTED WORKFLOW CANNOT BE INVOKED AS WRITTEN, AND IMPORTING IT SAYS OTHERWISE. A gxformat2
file whose steps name UDTs imports with every node present and no errors, then
`POST .../invocations` refuses with "the following required tools are not installed". A UDT is
addressed by UUID and its plain id is not in the toolbox the invocation gate consults. The fix is
the round trip: import the portable file, export Galaxy's NATIVE representation (which does carry
`tool_uuid`), resolve identities there, re-import that. Hand-authoring the native dict 500s.

⚠ THE UDT SET IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED, and that is the difference that makes this generic. Each
`udt/*.gxtool.yml` declares its own `id`; a workflow step naming one of those ids needs it
registered. A hardcoded tuple (`softmask_lib.UDTS`) is correct for exactly one workflow and is
silently wrong for the next -- registering too few fails at invoke with a list of missing tools,
and registering too many leaves unused tools on the account.
