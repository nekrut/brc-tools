"""Verify a softmask invocation by recomputing its mask two independent ways.

⛔ "42 JOBS OK" IS NOT EVIDENCE THE OUTPUT IS RIGHT, AND THIS PIPELINE HAS ALREADY PROVED IT. Every
step of the committed workflow exited 0 while `maskfasta` was being fed the ORIGINAL assembly
instead of the uppercased one, so the published `softmasked_fasta` carried NCBI's pre-existing mask
unioned with this workflow's, indistinguishably -- and the invocation summary was entirely green.
An invocation summary reports scheduling, not correctness.

THE CHECK. For each strain, two numbers derived from different files by different tools, which must
agree if the pipeline is sound:

    A. bases covered by the merged union BED   (from the intervals, via bedtools merge)
    B. lowercase bases in the soft-masked FASTA (from the sequence, via bedtools maskfasta)

A == B exactly, or the mask APPLIED is not the mask COMPUTED. Under the old wiring B exceeded A by
whatever the assembly arrived carrying -- for cs10 that is tens of percent, not a rounding error.

⚠ It also asserts the uppercased input really is uppercase. Without that, A == B could hold with
both wrong.

⛔ RESOLVE BY INVOCATION, NOT BY SCANNING A HISTORY. The previous version searched a history for
collections whose NAMES matched `"Merged "` / `"bedtools MaskFastaBed"` and took the highest hid of
each, independently. Two consequences, both silent:

  * Those are ToolShed-derived DEFAULT names that nothing in this repo generates or asserts. One
    tool version bump and the script exits "is this a completed softmask run?" -- a false negative
    that reads like the run failed.
  * `build_up_softmask.py` runs all seven tiers into ONE history, and tiers 6 and 7 both produce a
    merged BED and a masked FASTA. Nothing tied the three collections to a single invocation, so a
    partially-failed tier 7 could have the union read from one tier and the FASTA from another --
    and the script would still print "the mask applied is exactly the mask computed".

An invocation exposes `output_collections` keyed by the workflow's OWN declared output names, so
`--invocation` resolves each collection exactly and cannot cross runs.
