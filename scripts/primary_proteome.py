"""Reduce a protein FASTA to ONE protein per gene, keeping the longest.

⛔ WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL: BUSCO's `duplicated` FRACTION IS AN ANNOTATION ARTIFACT UNLESS EVERY
MEMBER OF THE PANEL USES ONE RULE. BUSCO protein mode scores a proteome against single-copy
orthologs, so two isoforms of one gene both hit the same ortholog and the group is called
duplicated. `complete` and `missing` barely move; `duplicated` moves a lot.

⚠ AND `duplicated` IS A NUMBER THIS PANEL ACTUALLY READS. Eight of the cannabis assemblies are
haplotype pairs, where duplication legitimately means the assembly has not collapsed its
haplotypes -- workflows/workflow_descriptions.md says so. Mix isoform noise in and you cannot tell
annotation style from assembly biology, which destroys the one signal the number carries here.

⛔ THE RULE IS "LONGEST PER GENE" BECAUSE THE EXISTING RULE CANNOT BE EXTENDED. The six proteomes
staged so far carry `_protein_primary.faa.gz` files whose record counts equal NCBI's own
`protein_coding` gene totals exactly -- cs10 33,674 -> 25,296, ASM2916894v1 39,959 -> 28,747 -- so
they were built by taking NCBI's DESIGNATED primary transcript. Measured: the records cs10 discards
average 513 aa against the 438 aa kept, so it is demonstrably not the longest isoform. That
designation is a RefSeq annotation attribute; GenBank submitter annotations and GigaDB's published
files do not carry it, so the rule stops working the moment a proteome arrives from anywhere else.
Longest-per-gene needs nothing but the FASTA, which is why it is the rule that can cover the panel.

⚠ HOW THE GENE IS IDENTIFIED IS PER-SOURCE, AND GUESSING IT IS THE WAY TO GET THIS SILENTLY WRONG.
A pattern that fails to group isoforms leaves the file unchanged and reports success, which looks
exactly like a proteome that was already one-per-gene. So `--gene-regex` is REQUIRED, and the
summary prints how many genes had more than one transcript: if that is 0 on a file you expected to
reduce, the pattern did not match, not the data.
