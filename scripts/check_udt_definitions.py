"""Static lint for a Galaxy User-Defined Tool: the `udt-authoring` skill, mechanised.

⛔ A CHECKLIST A HUMAN RUNS IS A CHECKLIST A HUMAN SKIPS. The `udt-authoring` skill ships a
27-row "common mistakes" table and a 13-item pre-submit checklist, and this repository has shipped
five of those mistakes anyway -- three of them in tools that were then invoked on a live Galaxy and
had NEVER been capable of running. The rules were written down the whole time. What was missing was
something that reads them on every file, every time, without being asked.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not `galaxy-tool-util`. The skill's own `scripts/validate.py` runs the
server's real `UserToolSource` model and `lint_user_tool_source`, and where that is installed it is
the better authority for the SCHEMA half below -- run both. This one needs nothing but PyYAML, so
it runs in any checkout and in CI, and it goes further than the schema in the two directions that
actually cost this project time:

  * TEMPLATING -- what `$(...)` means, which the schema does not model at all. Galaxy owns that
    sequence and interpolates it ANYWHERE in a `shell_command`, heredocs included. Every finding
    here was measured on a real job, not inferred.
  * SILENT SUCCESS -- a tool that exits 0 having produced nothing, or the wrong thing. No schema
    can see these; they were found by attacking the tools with adversarial inputs, and each one is
    named with the case that produced it.

⚠ CLEAN HERE DOES NOT MEAN THE TOOL RUNS. Nothing offline can tell you the container image exists
-- a wrong build tag is the single most common real UDT failure ("manifest unknown", at run time,
after a clean create) -- nor that the command works, nor that the server's role and job-config
gates will let it execute. This narrows the search; it does not end it.

Exit status is 1 if any PROBLEM was found. Notes never fail the run.
